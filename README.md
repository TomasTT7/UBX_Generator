# UBX_Generator
A generator of UBX-NAV-PVT (0x01 0x07) messages as output by GPS modules such as U-BLOX MAX-M8Q. It was written to help test a GPS data parser and telemetry constructor for a high altitude balloon tracker.

###Usage:

Fill the 'input.txt' file with latitude, longitude and altitude data separated by commas one triplet per line of text.

```
53.904171,-1.364825,612
53.906166,-1.370485,1788
53.905766,-1.357668,2421
```
The result will be placed in 'output.txt' file in the following format.
```
